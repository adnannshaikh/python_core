'''
A website requires the users to input username and password to register.
Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.

Following are the criteria for checking the password:

At least 1 letter between [a-z]
At least 1 number between [0-9]
At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
At least 1 character from [$#@]
Minimum length of transaction password: 6
Maximum length of transaction password: 12
Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check
them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be
printed, each separated by a comma.

Example

If the following passwords are given as input to the program:

ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345
Then, the output of the program should be:

ABd1234@1
'''

import re

validity = re.compile(r"^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[$#@])[A-Za-z\d$#@]{6,12}$")
password = input().split(',')
new_lst = []
for i in password:
    if validity.match(i):
        new_lst.append(i)

print(','.join(new_lst))
