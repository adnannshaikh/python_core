'''
Given 2 sets of integers, M and N, print their symmetric difference in ascending
order. The term symmetric difference indicates those values that exist in either M
or N but do not exist in both.

Input

The first line of input contains an integer, M.The second line contains M
space-separated integers.The third line contains an integer, N.The fourth line
contains N space-separated integers.
